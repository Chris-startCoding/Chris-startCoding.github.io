                <p class="featured-desc">I envision design as a tool to bridge the gap between the digital and physical world. While digital technologies develop and improve rapidly, physical interactions with products using these technologies remain superficial. Think about how interacting with the entire internet boils down to tapping a six inch glass screen with two fingers, even though our bodies are dextrous enough for product interactions to take an endless variety of forms. <br><br>
                    Simultaneously, there is a growing call to teach children about digital technologies, letting them become accustomed to using digital products at an early age, and teaching them code like it's their second language. <br><br>
                    We should not however neglect the importance of letting a child discover the world around them, understand its physical properties and learn to manipulate them. <br><br>
                    I am inspired by Froebel’s gifts, a series of toys designed in the 19th century to educate children about the physical properties of objects trough exploration, play and creativity. Though these toys might seem dated, what they teach a child about the physical world around us remains invaluable. <br><br>
                    In a society that’s ever changing, I think it’s the responsibility of designers in education to adapt learning accordingly. However in doing so, we should not forget the value of traditional teaching methods. Innovation for the sake of developments in education proven to be effective, over innovation for innovation itself. <br><br>
                    To me, digital and physical interactions should not be either or. Instead I see value in combining them, creating products with the endless possibilities of digital technology, while embracing the human body and using it to its full capabilities. When we interact with the digital world with physical products, I see opportunities for more expression, exploration and a better human experience with digital technologies. Resulting in a design mentality that doesn’t see the value of technological advancements for the technology itself, but for what it can offer to us people. <br><br>
                    I see designing for and in accordance with the user as a given for an Industrial Designer. I do believe, however, that while doing so we should think critically of what conveniences we intend to provide to people. As products and services become increasingly convenient and efficient, so do the possibilities for overconsumption and pollution. While designing a product to fulfil a certain need, we should always take into account its environmental costs; before, during and after its use.

                <p class="featured-desc">Following my bachelor Industrial Design, I intend on finishing the Educational minor by February 2023 to become a physics teacher. Doing so, I want to further explore my interest in education. It also gives me time to reflect on the past years of studying and decide what Master’s I want to do.
                    I definitely intend on developing myself further in designing and making. Next to the minor and being a teacher, I want to start a design studio this year designing and selling art pieces under the pseudonym <a href="https://www.instagram.com/straatduif_/" class="text-link">Straatduif</a>. As of now, I have made illustrations under this name only to post on Instagram or gift to friends and family. Inspired by artists like Jeff Koons, KAWS, Josh Sperling and Julian Opie, I want to develop this further into making sculptural art.
                    Additionally, design studios focused on play and education like Studio Tast remain in the back of my head as potential places to do an internship or possibly apply for in the future.
