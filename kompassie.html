                <p class="featured-title">Kompassie</p>
                <p class="featured-desc">Kompassie is a tool that allows users to communicate freely with large groups of people with the help off location-based communication. <br><br>

                    The concept originated as a reaction to the many high school students who during times like these are to spend their recess at home and on their own, instead of socializing with their peers like they could do beforehand. <br><br>
                    
                    Looking at current remote communication tools, they are well designed for communicating with groups of up to 4, maybe 5 people, but after that they seem overcrowded and useless. Additionally, the act of calling can pose a barrier for users to talk to people they would have no problem approaching in real life. <br><br>
                    
                    To study whether an artefact could combat this problem, we set up the research question: How does  an artifact that simulates the approachable nature of communication between high school students during conventional recess affect the social interaction during isolation? <br><br>
                    
                    We answer this question by studying how high school students experience their recess during isolation, letting them use our functioning platform during recess for a week afterwards and comparing these experiences. <br><br>
                    
                    Kompassie simulates this approachable nature of communication by shifting from being call based, to location based. Users of Kompassie enter a virtual room with as many people as they want. They move through this virtual room by physically walking through for example their own bedroom. Doing so they move closer or farther away from their peers. While being always able to see everyone present in the room, they can only hear and be heard by the people closest to them. This prevents the overcrowding and allows the users to choose with who they want to talk, while always being able to approach, or be approached by others without having to end a call. <br><br>
                    
                    With Kompassie: We bring those closer who are far away. <br><br>
