                <p class="featured-title">Identity</p>
                <p class="featured-desc">I define myself as a well-rounded designer who, through development in all expertise areas, is equally involved in the entire design process. Throughout life I have always had many varying interests, where obsessions for varying topics arose as quickly as they left. In my studies, this resulted in wanting to develop all expertise areas equally, for long not knowing what areas to specialize in. While I found this frustrating at first, I now believe it helps me in applying a broader set of knowledge and skills to specific topics. <br><br>
                    Through my courses and projects I have discovered the fields I want to design for. These being education, play and combining digital technologies with physical product design. <br><br>
                    Most of all, I get motivation and inspiration from making. Whether that’d be making physical prototypes, digital apps or a combination of both. My developments in the expertise area Technology & Realization and Math, Data & Computing allow me to make these kinds of products effectively. While developments in User & Society and Business & Entrepreneurship guide me in how to design products with my vision of design in mind. <br><br>
                    In design projects, I function best as an advisor and a mediator. Working together with others, I find it important that everyone is able to speak their mind and that there is always room for open discussion. Doing so, I make sure that my opinions are heard as well, even when they contradict that of others; there should always be room for critical views and opinions. <br><br>
                    Working alone during my graduation project I have become more aware of my weaknesses as a designer. When I do not find what I’m working on within a design process to be of interest, I find it very difficult to find the energy and motivation to progress. Leaving me in a rut where development is exceedingly slow. Contrarily when I’m too focused on one aspect of the design process, I can forget to incorporate other necessary parts needed to progress.
