                <p class="featured-title">Fitit</p>
                <p class="featured-desc">FitIt is a toy that enables children to build whatever they desire out of cardboard with a sustainable product. It does so by making use of ‘fitters’, round wooden discs in which pieces of cardboard can be pressed together to make all kinds of shapes and structures. The power of cardboard for our product is that it is a cheap, accessible and sustainable material. Because the fitters are made out of MDF, they are also recyclable.<br><br>
                    The goal of our project is to stimulate children to express their creativity by building their own toys with accessible materials. By delivering building kits with which children can build premade structures with the help of our fitters and an instruction booklet, children are introduced to our product and inspired to build on their own from there. <br><br>
                    As an extension to these building kits, electrical components are provided separately to introduce children to the concept of working with electronics at a young age, and to keep our product interesting to a wider target group. By setting up a website where children can share their projects and see those of others, further stimulating each other’s creativity. <br><br>

                    After finishing the project, my group mates and I further developed and produced our product under the company name <a href="https://www.fitit.fun/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Fitit</a>.
