                <p class="featured-title">Creativity & Aesthetics</p>
                <p class="featured-desc">During my projects, I have used several design philosophies and principles as a starting point of my design. Starting from paper and cardboard, the Material Driven Design Method was used in my <a href="fitit.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">first project</a> to make and experience exploratory prototypes. Through this process, I developed a wooden toy which makes building and playing with leftover cardboard accessible to children. Before going into the project, the course Socio-cultural Sensitivity had taught me the function and meaning of products through ethics, sustainability, history and interculturality. Two design philosophies discussed in this course were applied in the project: <br><br>
                    Cradle To Cradle: the product is made solely from sustainable wood, using a laser cutter producing minimal waste products and is completely recyclable. <br><br>
                    Form Follows Function: through prototyping and testing, the form was adjusted to optimally perform its function. <br><br>
                    As for creative and brainstorming techniques, body mapping and experience design were used in my <a href="Final report Thalia B21.pdf" target="_blank" class="text-link">second</a> and <a href="kompassie.html" class="text-link">third project</a> respectively. For the latter, I developed a product that replaced the traditional recess experience that was drastically affected by Covid restrictions for high school students. The final design implemented elements of recess and the approachable nature of communication of talking with their peers in real life into a handheld product that let’s users experience this remotely at home. <br><br>
                    The use and value of body mapping was later elaborated on in the course Aesthetics of Interaction where I learned about Soma design as a way of examining and improving on connections between sensation, emotion and (somaesthetic) product design. <br><br>
                    Using the book Stop Stealing Sheep & Find Out how Type Works as a starting point - recommended during the course From Idea to Design –, I developed an expertise over the years in creating posters with software like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and Keyshot as a way of communicating products to the viewer. <br><br>
                    In my <a href="arthropolis.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">Final Bachelor Project</a> I used my developments in this expertise area to design a product with illustrations that relate to the user and the products environment. Doing so, requires a sufficient understanding of the user, as explained in the User & Society expertise area. <br><br>

                <p class="featured-desc">Inevitable aspects of a products and its design are its user, and the society it resides in. And by designers, these should always be accounted for. <br><br>
                    <a href="DCB170_Socio.pdf" target="_blank" class="text-link">“At the start of creative freedom lies the social environment of the creator. At the end lies their moral responsibility”
                    </a><br><br>
                    Regarding this expertise area, relevant skills like developing questionnaires and interviews and knowledge on how to use these in the design process were acquired early on in the course User Centred Design. I applied these in my <a href="fitit.html" class="text-link">first project</a> by conducting user tests with our target group (children between 4-12 years old) to test and improve the functionality and usability of our product and the product manual. Through a second user test, these improvements were validated. <br><br>
                    I further developed these skills in later projects. By reading the book Observing the User Experience, I learned how to use more extensive user evaluation methods in later projects. Methods like card sorting, social mapping and sentence completion were performed with high school students for our <a href="kompassie.html" class="text-link">third project</a>. Social mapping for example not only analyses the user itself, it also gave insights about the social space they reside in. These qualitative research methods were analysed using methods like thematic analysis learned in the course Design <> Research. <br><br>
                    During my <a href="arthropolis.html" class="text-link">Final Bachelor Project</a>, I gained an insight in my target demographic using expert interviews and theoretical background research to position my product in the relevant environment.

                <p class="featured-desc">This expertise area envelops the use of technology in the development of a product and realizing its physical qualities and functions. <br><br>
                    During my studies, I got to work with numerous production methods, machines and materials. Most prototypes for my <a href="fitit.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">first project</a> were made using a laser cutter for example. I gained an affinity in this production tool after this project, however, when I experimented with different settings and wood types in search for an efficient method of producing our prototype for my start up <a href="https://www.fitit.fun/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Fitit</a>.<br><br>
                    Other skills in product realisation I developed include 3D modelling and printing. I developed skills in using Solidworks during the course Creative Mechanical Engineering. I got to apply this skill to create and print 3D models during the course Engineering Design and my <a href="kompassie.html" target="_blank" target="_blank" class="text-link">third project</a>. This course, in addition to the book The Elements of Mechanical Design also taught me important principles of mechanical design like using exact constraints, triangulation and planning load paths to create mechanically stable products. <br><br>
                    Through the courses Creative Programming and Creative Electronics, I gained knowledge on how to build circuits and enrich a product’s functionalities with electronics. I used these extensively in my <a href="Final report Thalia B21.pdf" target="_blank" class="text-link">second</a> and <a href="kompassie.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">third project</a>, though mostly to create non-functional demonstrative prototypes. My development in using electronics and Arduino code, further elaborated in the Math, Data & Computing expertise area, enabled me to create a fully functioning prototype later on during my <a href="arthropolis.html" class="text-link">Final Bachelor Project</a>. While the desired aesthetical qualities were realised using familiar production methods like laser cutting and woodworking. <br><br>

                <p class="featured-title">Math, Data & Computing</p>
                <p class="featured-desc">Within this expertise area, I mostly developed my skills and knowledge in computing and writing code. I learnt how to write simple code in Processing and Arduino early on in the studies during the course Creative Programming. During my <a href="Final report Thalia B21.pdf" target="_blank" class="text-link">second project</a>, I was able to apply this skill by integrating LEDs and moving parts using servo motors into our physical prototype using Arduino code. I further developed my Processing skills by working with a vocal recognition software developed by coach Rong Hao and tailoring it to our project. <br><br>
                    This allowed me to use Processing to create an experience prototype during my <a href="kompassie.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">third project</a>. During this project, I taught myself to write code in C++ and Unity to create our final digital prototype based on the experience prototype. Using this prototype, high school students could join a virtual room where they could move around and talk with up to 20 people simultaneously online. <br><br>
                    During the course Creative Apps, I learnt how to develop more extensive digital programs (namely mobile apps) using Java. <br><br>
                    What I felt like lacked from the coding courses at the Industrial Design faculty was a more systematic way of teaching, with a focus on writing clear, efficient code and an understanding of the computational processes behind it. For this reason, I followed the minor Programming at the University of Amsterdam. Besides gaining a more in-depth knowledge on how code should be written, I learnt to write code in C, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br><br>
                    To maintain these skills, as they were not used in further design projects, I made this portfolio from scratch by writing HTML and CSS code. <br><br>
                    I got introduced to working with large datasets in Python during the course Data Science for Engineers. During the course Making Sense of Sensors, this skill was further developed to analyse data on users’ heart rate during their sleep.

                <p class="featured-title">Business & Entrepreneurship</p>
                <p class="featured-desc">Over several courses, I have gained knowledge on the importance and use of this expertise area within design. Courses like Design Innovation Methods and the USE line New Product Development and Marketing have taught me how to use tools like Value Proposition Canvas, Persona’s and Customer Journey Maps to aid designing a product that creates value for the user and involved stakeholders. These skills were supported by knowledge on market segmentation, the BCG matrix and strategies like the Blue Ocean Strategy. I have always found it difficult however to incorporate this knowledge in my projects and designs. <br><br>
                    What taught me most about this expertise area has been to become an entrepreneur myself. After my first project, my group mates and I founded a start-up to further develop, produce and sell our product under the name <a href="https://www.fitit.fun/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Fitit</a>. Working with clients and customers directly, we got to design and sell products that fit their needs and values, After getting into contact with Korein via a Lucid event, we sold products and workshops to their afterschool day-cares. By participating in the LOAD program with our start-up, I learned how to create customer journey maps and personas based on user evaluation methods and apply these to our actual company. Where in the User & Society expertise area, these skills would be used for example to change the design in accordance with the user, here they were used to effectively position and market the existing product to the customer. <br><br>
                    Through <a href="https://www.fitit.fun/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Fitit</a>, I also gained experience in presenting our product to potential clients and investors, and finding ways to increase profits by cutting production costs. Relating to the Technology & Research expertise area, this was done by working together with several production companies in Eindhoven and doing extensive testing with their laser-cutters. <br><br>

                <p class="featured-desc">As described in the Creativity & Aesthetics expertise area, I have used various design processes and approaches throughout my project, depending on their relevancy. In these projects, prototyping, desktop research, creative techniques and user evaluation methods were alternated to compose the entire design process. Over the course of the past projects, this has developed into desktop research and user evaluation methods taking a much more important role in my <a href="kompassie.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">third project</a> and my <a href="arthropolis.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">Final Bachelor Project</a> than the previous two projects. <br><br>
                    Throughout these projects, I have developed skills in research processes both using secondary research, as well as analysing results from research done during the design process. In my <a href="kompassie.html" class="text-link">third project</a> for example, I did research about the approachable nature of communication of various communication tools. This served as both an insight in design opportunities for our product, as well as a means of validating its effectiveness compared to existing solutions. The product I designed during my <a href="arthropolis.html" target="_blank" class="text-link">Final Bachelor Project</a> was made to reflect a city as it transitions from producing and eating meat to producing and eating insects. To do so, theoretical research provided as a guideline in creating a representation of society that remained true to reality. <br><br>
                   Development in analysis of qualitative research during the design process is described in the User & Society expertise area.
